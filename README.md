•	Online Ordering: Implement an online ordering system using Javascript and a server-side language (e.g., PHP).

•	Reservation System: Develop a reservation system that interacts with the database for booking tables.

•	Advanced Search: Enhance the search functionality with Javascript to allow filtering by category, price, etc.

•	Content Management System (CMS): Consider using a CMS for easier content updates in the future.

Deployment:

•	Once you're satisfied with the website, you can deploy it to a web hosting service to make it accessible online. This will involve uploading the website 
        files and configuring your domain name.

Note: This is a basic website built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There are many online resources and tutorials available to learn more about these languages and web development concepts.
